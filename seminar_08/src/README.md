## Structural Patterns

### Adapter - Class or Object
> keywords: `external library`
- the interface/framework that we want to adapt is the "old" or "existing" class/context
  - `old/existing` -> `external`
  - `new` -> `internal` (the result)

### Decorator
> keywords: `changing objects at run-time`
- is all about *objects*
