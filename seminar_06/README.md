## FACTORY
Type: ***CREATIONAL***
### The Problem to be Solved
- 

1. We are developing a game with different characters.
Something like 'Space Invaders'. We will have different frameworks for:
- space objects: planets, moons, meteorites etc.
- spaceships
- aliens

All classes provide different attributes and different constructors (with different combinations of parameters).\
Provide a solution for developers to create all these things without being dependent on all these details. `->` *loose coupling approach (DIP)*

Future changes related to the creation of different objects should not affect the existing solution.

`keywords`: `different frameworks` `(complex environment)`, `different attributes`, `different constructors`, `different combinations of constructors`, `future changes should not influence ... the solution`

2. 
`keywords`: `single/unique`
